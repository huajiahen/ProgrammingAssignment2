## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it 
## repeatedly. You can use makeCacheMatrix to creat a special "matrix" 
## which can cache its inverse matrix. You should always use 'cacheSolve' 
## function to get the inverse matrix from special "matrix".

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned 
## by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        i <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setInverse(i)
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        i
}
